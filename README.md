# EE282-HW3
A repository for HW3

### This repository contains three separate scripts--
 1. The first, **genome.summary.md**, provides my solution to the first question on HW3 by calculating the total number of nucleotides, total number of Ns, and total number of sequences for the _D. melanogaster_ genome.
 2. The second, **feature.summary.md**, answers the first question in the annotation summary section of the homework by providing the total number of each genomic feature, listed from most common to least common.
 3. The third, **genecount.md**, answers the final section of the homework, providing the number of genes on each chromosome
